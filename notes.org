* Balancing the GAN game:  
** L2 penalty on D's weights 
   I applied the strategy of controlling D to be better than G, while
   not much better than G. This is done by dynamically controlling the
   L2 weight decay (referred to as /coefL2/ in code). 

** Early stage 
   I saw in early stage, D is always being updated; G is updated much
   less than D.
